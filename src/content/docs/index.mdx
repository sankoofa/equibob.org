## Key Features

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Customizable" icon="pencil">
        Vesktop comes with [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) out of the box, allowing you to customize your Discord
        experience with many powerful plugins and themes.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Privacy friendly" icon="seti:ignored">
        Vesktop is [open source](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) and does not include any tracking or telemetry.
        Blocks Discord telemetry out of the box and heavily limits Discord's access to your system.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Lightweight" icon="rocket">
        Vesktop is much more lightweight than the official Discord app, possibly leading to better performance
        (depending on your system).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Better Linux experience" icon="linux">
        Vesktop is built with Linux in mind. Allows you to stream with system audio.
